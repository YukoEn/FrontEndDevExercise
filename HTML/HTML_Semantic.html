            <h3>What is Tofu?</h3>
            <p>Tofu, or bean curd, is a popular food derived from soya.
                It is made by curdling fresh soya milk, pressing it into a solid block and then cooling it
                – in much the same way that traditional dairy cheese is made by curdling and solidifying milk.
                The liquid (whey) is discarded, and the curds are pressed to form a cohesive bond.
                A staple ingredient in Thai and Chinese cookery, it can be cooked in different ways to change its
                texture from smooth and soft to crisp and crunchy.</p>
